    - title: Advanced Computer Scientist
      institution: SRI
      year: 2021 - Present
      description:
        - ARPA-H PARADIGM - Leading the medical object detection and segmentation effort, and working towards a LLM-based task guidance and planning system to help inexperienced healthcare providers in low-resource rural settings.
        - DARPA CCU - Developed automated modules for facial analysis, scene understanding and dialogue assessment to help improve operator situational awareness and interactional effectiveness in various cross-cultural settings.
        - DARPA EDGE - Developed an emotion recognition and feedback pipeline to help design better human machine interfaces (HMI) for better operator situational awareness in off-nominal situations.
        - NSF - Served as the co-PI  and developed automated student group collaboration assessment and recommendation systems by modeling individual-level and group-level behaviors in online and in-person classroom settings.
        - Commercial - Delivered proof-of-concepts and functional prototypes for high-profile commercial clients.

    - title: Research Intern
      institution: [SRI](https://www.sri.com)
      year: 2020
      description: 
        - Developed deep-learning-based algorithms for multimodal behavior analysis and assessment of student group collaboration in a classroom setting. The deep-learning models were designed with the objective of providing meaningful information to teachers and actionable feedback to students.

    - title: Digital Pathology Intern
      institution: [Roche](https://diagnostics.roche.com/)
      year: 2018
      description:
        - Developed deep-learning-based image segmentation pipelines to identify regions of necrosis in multiplex immunofluorescence digital pathology images. Worked closely with the software platform team to integrate the trained deep-learning model on the internal research software platform for enabling Field-Of-View (FOV) and Whole-Slide-Image (WSI) inference.

    - title: Computation Intern
      institution: [Lawrence Livermore National Lab.](https://www.llnl.gov/)
      year: 2018
      description:
        - Developed time-series-based deep-learning algorithms to model electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of different heart disease conditions. Proposed and implemented several strategies to handle the data-imbalance problem across the different heart disease categories.

    - title: Graduate Intern
      institution: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiation-oncology/home/orc-20188588)
      year: 2015
      description:
        - Developed image processing and machine learning algorithms for identifying cancerous tissue regions in CT and MRI images.
